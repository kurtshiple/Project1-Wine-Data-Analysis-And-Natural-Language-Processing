# Project1-Wine-Data-Analysis-And-Natural-Language-Processing

The purpose of this project was to take two datasets, one of wine around the world and the other of chemical properties of different wine varieties and make as many insights with the data as possible. 

This involved using a google maps api in order to add coordinates to the wineries around the world, regression packages, geomapping packages, and a natural language processing package to develop a virtual wine somellier that would be able to recommend a wine variety after the user inputs a description of the type of flavor or pallete they're looking for.
